## Installation

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (10 or above)

Install from this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hreyesm/google-forms-automation
```

After cloning the repository, go to the root directory and enter the command `npm install` to install [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Usage

### JSON File Location

JSON files corresponding to the forms to be filled out will only be processed if they are inside the [forms](./cypress/fixtures/forms) subdirectory, as in the directory tree below; otherwise the script will not recognize them.

```
ðŸ“¦ google-forms-automation
â”£ ðŸ“‚ cypress
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ fixtures
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ forms
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“„ fixed.json
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“„ probabilistic.json
```

### JSON File Format

The general structure of a JSON file supported by the script looks like the following:

```
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "questions": [ ... ]
}
```

For a JSON file to work properly, it must be formatted according to the guidelines below.

#### URL

Due to how Cypress redirects to web pages, the URL to be included in the JSON file **should not be abbreviated.** For example, a valid URL would be https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZOj6_2ryFbvfrzTyCUT6prKCP7blBJpq9SIJnwPFl4X9hRQ/viewform?usp=sf_link, while an invalid one would be https://forms.gle/2vXJ9zTJdR664c9TA. Feel free to use the first one to test the script yourself.

#### Questions

The format of the questions to be included in the JSON file will vary depending on the nature of their respective answers. **Questions must be added to the** `"questions"` **array in the exact order they appear on the original form.**

- **Fixed Fill Pattern Only**

  - Short Answer

    ```
    {
      "title": "Question title",
      "type": "shortAnswer",

      }
    }
    ```

  - Paragraph

    ```
    {
      "title": "Question title",
      "type": "paragraph",
      "answer": {
        "value": "Value to fill"
      }
    }
    ```

          "probabilities": [P("Option 1"), ..., P("Option N")]
        }
      }
      ```

  - Multiple Choice Grid

    ```
    {
      "title": "Question title",
      "type": "multipleChoiceGrid",
      "rows": [
        {
          "title": "Row 1",
          "answer": {
            "pattern": "fixed",
            "choice": "Column to select"
          }
        }, ...,
        {
          "title": "Row N",
          "answer": {
            "pattern": "probabilistic",
            "options": ["Column 1", ..., "Column N"],
            "probabilities": [P("Column 1"), ..., P("Column N")]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  - Checkbox Grid

    ```
    {
      "title": "Question title",
      "type": "checkboxGrid",
      "rows": [
        {
          "title": "Row 1",
          "answer": {
            "pattern": "fixed",
            "choice": ["Column to select"]
          }
        }, ...,
        {
          "title": "Row N",
          "answer": {
            "pattern": "probabilistic",
            "options": ["Column 1", ..., "Column N"],
            "probabilities": [P("Column 1"), ..., P("Column N")]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

#### Section End and Form End Flags

To instruct the script to go to the next section of a form, simply add a `"sectionEnd"` flag to the last question in a section:

```
{
  "title": "Question title",
  "type": "questionType",
  "answer": { ... },
  "sectionEnd": true
}
```

Similarly, to submit a form, add a `"formEnd"` flag to the last question in the form:

```
{
  "title": "Question title",
  "type": "questionType",
  "answer": { ... },
  "formEnd": true
}
```

The [example.json](./cypress/fixtures/forms/example.json) file included in this repository should give you a good idea on how to structure the form data.

### Graphical View

From the root directory, enter the following command to open the graphical Cypress Test Runner:

```
npx cypress open -e FORM=<Name of JSON file with form data>,N=<# of iterations>
```

For example, if we wanted the script to fill out the form specified in the [example.json](./cypress/fixtures/forms/example.json) file a total of three times, we would enter the command as follows:
![](./img/open.jpg)

If successful, the command should open a window similar to this:
![](./img/test-runner.jpg)

After that, click on the **google-forms-automation.spec.js** file shown. A Chrome window like the one below should appear:
![](./img/chrome.jpg)

The script should start running shortly after.

### Command Line View

From the root directory, enter the following command to run the command-line Cypress Test Runner:

```
npx cypress run -e FORM=<Name of JSON file with form data>,N=<# of iterations>
```

For example, if we wanted the script to fill out the form specified in the [example.json](./cypress/fixtures/forms/example.json) file a total of three times, we would enter the command as follows:
![](./img/run.jpg)

The script should start running shortly after. If successful, the terminal should display the following information:
![](./img/command-line.jpg)
